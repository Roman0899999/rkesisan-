<h3>Linear Equations</h3> <br>


A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form <br>

  <h2 ><span >ax + b = 0</span> </h2>

where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an x there.<br>
<br>
<b>Quadratic Equation </b><br>
<br>
The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:<br>

 <h2 ><span > ax^2 + bx + c = 0 </span></h2>   

where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.<br>
<br>

<b> The area of a circle (A)</b><br>
<br>

[sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:<br>

  <h2 ><span >  A = [sign] [sign] r^2</span></h2> 

or, when you know the diameter (D):<br>
<h2 ><span > A = [sign] / 4) [sign] D^2 </span> </h2>

or, when you know the circumference (C):<br>
 <h2> <span>A = C^2 / 4 [sign] [sign]</span> </h2> 

<b>Intersection</b> <br>
<br>

The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,<br>

  <h2><span >A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }</span> </h2>

That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.</h3>
